# Python-Snake-Game


This project is a simple **Snake game** built in **Python** using the built-in `turtle` library.
I created it to learn **Python fundamentals through hands-on practice**.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python 3**
* **turtle** (standard Python library)
* **PyCharm**
* **Git & GitHub**

---

## What I learned

* Python basics (variables, conditions, loops, functions)
* Working with lists and basic object-oriented concepts
* Keyboard input and simple game logic (movement, collisions, scoring)
* Screen rendering and manual updates (`tracer`, `update`)
* Using **PyCharm**
* Basic **Git & GitHub** workflow (commits, branches, merges)

## Summary

This project helped me build a solid foundation in Python, learn how to use an IDE (PyCharm) effectively, and get familiar with version control using Git and GitHub.
It serves as a starting point for more advanced Python projects.
